# D3Charts Lab: Race Bar Chart
This project demonstrates the use of D3.js to create an interactive race bar chart that visualizes data for countries and companies. Users can select between "progressive" and "year-by-year" display modes and choose between "Companies" and "Countries" data sets. Upon submission, a race bar chart is dynamically generated with animations, showcasing the selected data over time.
